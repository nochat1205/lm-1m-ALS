FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE GROUPLENS RESEARCH PROJECT
================================================================================

The GroupLens Research Project is a research group in the Department of 
Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Members of 
the GroupLens Research Project are involved in many research projects related 
to the fields of information filtering, collaborative filtering, and 
recommender systems. The project is lead by professors John Riedl and Joseph 
Konstan. The project began to explore automated collaborative filtering in 
1992, but is most well known for its world wide trial of an automated 
collaborative filtering system for Usenet news in 1996. Since then the project 
has expanded its scope to research overall information filtering solutions, 
integrating in content-based methods as well as improving current collaborative 
filtering technology.

Further information on the GroupLens Research project, including research 
publications, can be found at the following web site:

GroupLens Research currently operates a movie recommender based on 
collaborative filtering:
